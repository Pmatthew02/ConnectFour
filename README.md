# ConnectFour
the game i created is an old childhood game of connect 4.
making connect 4 really pushed my limits in javascript. i really had to look into how to make the grid an how to make functions to check how you got connect 4 in any direction.

would liked to have been able to used divs better to make pop up screens or menus for the game.

the function used to find connect 4 in all directions is "window slider"

would like to be able to make a popup screen when game first loads an when someone wins.  being able to add a scoreboard to keep track of players score an also whos turn it currently is.
